# Yelp-Dataset-Ananlysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing user reviews from an e-commerce platform to distinguish between real and fake reviews. Utilizing a dataset of 20,000 records, the analysis explores various aspects such as review distribution, user behavior, and potential indicators of inauthentic reviews.

## Datasets
The analysis is based on the following datasets:

### Reviews Dataset: Contains user reviews including rating, text, and timestamps.
### User Dataset: Contains user information including user ID, elite status, and review counts.
### Business Dataset: Includes details about businesses that users reviewed.

## Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Distribution of reviews, user engagement, and review lengths.
User Behavior Analysis: Examination of posting frequency, geolocation, and time between reviews.
Visualization: Use of plots to illustrate distributions and trends.

## Limitations
Please note that the analysis is conducted on a sample size of 20,000 records instead of the complete 7 million records available in the original dataset. This limitation may affect the comprehensiveness of insights drawn from the analysis.
